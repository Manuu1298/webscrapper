  This script can be used to scrape keywords from all the text from any website that you add to the list.

<p>
  In the "keyword list" add any keywords that you would like to find from any page. In this case, the example list is to visit job boards from specific companies and see if they have those keywords on their page, which would indicate they have Job openings with those titles.
  Change or add any keywords according to your needs. 
</p>

<p>
  In the " urls = [ ] " section, you will add any pages that you want the scraper to review.
